+++

In October of 2016, I authored the <a href="https://github.com/bgnicoll/buttercms-csharp">C# library</a> for <a href="https://buttercms.com/">ButterCMS</a>, a "headless" CMS with a SaaS offering. Recently, the folks at Butter reached out to me again to write an article to highlight the benefits of running a headless CMS on Google Cloud Platform. The resulting article was posted as a Google Cloud Platform Partner Solution and can be found at the following link: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/solutions/partners/butter-headless-cms-on-gcp">https://cloud.google.com/solutions/partners/butter-headless-cms-on-gcp</a>. Thanks to the folks at Butter for giving me the opportunity!
